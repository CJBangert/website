                <h3>M&T Bank</h3>
                <h4>TDP Software Engineer</h4>
                <p>
                    In the Technology Development Rotaion Program. For my first rotation, I work with the Total Cash Team, where we own the applications pertaining to Payments and Fees for Wilmington Trust. Most of my development time is spent on the Total Cash application, which is used by the business to send money via wire, cash, check or ACH.<br>
                    My biggest contribution (which I'm most excited about) is taking a lead role in archtecting, designing and implementing a Risk Scoring application that calculates a numerical Risk Score to outgoing wires. Some might call it AI. This is built using Python, Flask, NumPy, C#, .NET, and SQL Server, and runs as it's own microservice on Windows Server 2012 (<i>Not the OS I would choose if I had the choice - USE LINUX OR NEWER WINDOWS FOR FLASK APP IF YOU CAN</i>). I had the experience of working on this from idea to MVP pilot.<br>
                    In addition to this, I also had the opprotunity to take a lead role in migrating to CI/CD automated database depoyments, and migrated our source code from TFS to Gitlab (mostly because I hated TFS the most out of everyone so I was most eager)<br>
                    Apart from development on my technical team, I am also responsible for crating new technical interview questions, building out our second round technical interviews, and training interviewers on how to use Codility to conduct them.

                    In this role, I was charged with developing and maintaining the Integration Test suite (Java with Spring libraries, Gherkin) for the John Deere Custom Performance (JDCP) platform<br>
                    These tests are used on the software found in John Deere factories, dealerships, and equipment all around the world- from Illinois to the remote forests of Norway.

                    In my first internship, I implemented mitigations in the source code (in C) for vulnerabilities exposed by the HP Fortify scan. This was an important item that ended up stuck in the backlog for a long time, but was crtical for the government customer. I achieved ahead of schedule and within the first month of my start date. This solution was deployed at JSOC, the Pentagon, J6, and probably other places.

            <p>
                In my first two years, I participated in the Public Leadership Scholars program. This was a 2-year program aimed at developing leadership/project management skills, along with Public Policy coursework. The program culminated in a capstone project where myself and two classmates led a small oyster restoration project in the Chesapeake Bay. This was along with the University of Maryland Center for Enviromental Science in Cambridge, MD. I also played club lacrosse in my spare time. <br>
                In the remaining two years, I participated in the Hinman CEOS Program. This was 2-year Living-Learning program intended to develop business leadership skills, particularly dealing with startups. This is where I earned my minor.<br>
                Also in my time at UMD (before COVID cut my senior year on campus short) I had the opprotunity to serve as the Treasurer of the UMD chapter of the International Justice Mission (IJM). In this role, I was responsible for helping plan and ensure funding for events to combat human trafficking locally within Prince George’s County and internationally.
